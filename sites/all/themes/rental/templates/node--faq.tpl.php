                  It depends a lot on the debtor and how important is their reputation to them. We find that auto reminder program and publicizing in social networks can be very effective.
                  The auto reminder program emails a reminder to a debtor with number of unique visitors that saw the publicized information every week. Publicizing in social networks such as Twitter and Facebook
                  directly informs the debtor' relatives, friends and family members about his/her financial obligations that proves to be very effective means to recover money. Important to note, by publicizing the
                  information you do more than recovering money. You are helping others avoid the financial scam and untrustworthy people.
