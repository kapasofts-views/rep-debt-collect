                  It depends a lot on the debtor and how important is their reputation to them. We find that auto reminder program and publicizing in social networks can be very effective.
                  The auto reminder program emails a reminder to a debtor with number of unique visitors that saw the publicized information every week. Publicizing in social networks such as Twitter and Facebook
                  directly informs the debtor' relatives, friends and family members about his/her financial obligations that proves to be very effective means to recover money. Important to note, by publicizing the
                  information you do more than recovering money. You are helping others avoid the financial scam and untrustworthy people.

                  Yes. We would also publicize the debtor's response to your publicized information if he/she requests. This is because we pride ourselves for providing
                  equal and fear platform to publicize information for all. Our philosophy is that we believe each individual is critical thinker who is able to decide the truthfulness
                  of the publicized information on his own. Therefore, it is good reason for you to publicize as much evidence as possible, so others have enough information
                  when evaluating your publicized information. While debtor can publicize their response to your publicized information, you will always have the chance to comment last and
                  update your publicized info content as you wish.
